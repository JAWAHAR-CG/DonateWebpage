		<h2>ABOUT CHARITY</h2>
		<p>Started in 2010, we have grown through the years to be the most trusted crowdfunding platform in India. The belief that people are inherently humane and willing to help forms the crux of what we do. We have been able to use technology to its best and make online giving a seamless and transparent process. Anyone across the country, irrespective of their socio-economic background can raise a fundraiser on Milaap. We believe that in the years to come online giving will be ‘the’ way to charitable and humanitarian acts.<p>

		<h2>MARDO MERK</h2>
		<p>DoniCharity has an "ask for update" section which comes back with a update usually filled with smiles. I tend to go back looking for a positive update. It would make sense for online charities to do this proactively to create a reward for donors. Try making this a habit.</p>
